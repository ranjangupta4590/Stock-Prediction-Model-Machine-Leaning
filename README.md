# üìà Stock Price Prediction Model

A Streamlit-based web application that predicts future stock prices using LSTM (Long Short-Term Memory) neural networks. This project utilizes historical stock data from Yahoo Finance via the `yfinance` API and presents interactive visualizations and predictions to the user.

## üì¶ Setup Instructions

### 1. Clone the Repository

```bash
git clone https://github.com/ranjangupta4590/Stock-Prediction-Model-Machine-Leaning.git
````

### 2. Create a Virtual Environment (Optional but Recommended)

```bash
python -m venv venv
venv\Scripts\activate      # For Windows
# OR
source venv/bin/activate   # For macOS/Linux
```

### 3. Install Dependencies

```bash
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

> If `requirements.txt` is not present, install manually:

```bash
pip install numpy pandas yfinance matplotlib scikit-learn tensorflow streamlit
```

### 4. Train the Model (Optional)

If the `.keras` model is not already present, run the training script via notebook:

```bash
jupyter notebook stocksanalysis.ipynb
```

Make sure the last line in the notebook executes:

```python
model.save('F:/Stock Prediction Model/Stock Analysis Model.keras')
```

### 5. Run the Application

Make sure `main.py` is updated with the correct path to your `.keras` file.

Then, run:

```bash
streamlit run main.py
```

## üí° How It Works

1. User enters a stock ticker symbol (e.g., `GOOG`)
2. The app fetches historical stock data from Yahoo Finance (2020 to 2025)
3. Visualizes:

   * Raw stock price
   * 50-day, 100-day, and 200-day moving averages
4. The LSTM model trained on the closing prices predicts future stock prices
5. The app compares and visualizes original vs predicted prices

---

## üß† Model Architecture

* 4 LSTM layers with ReLU activation and increasing units
* Dropout layers to prevent overfitting
* Final Dense layer to predict closing price
* Trained on 80% of historical closing prices, 20% used for testing
